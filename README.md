## Introduction

Windows lacks a unified package manager like those found in Linux distributions, such as APT (Advanced Package Tool) or YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified). However, several package managers have emerged to fill this gap, providing similar functionality for Windows users. This repository serves as a curated collection of information about these package managers, their features, and how to use them effectively.

## Supported Package Managers

Currently, this repository provides information and resources for the following Windows package managers:

- **Chocolatey**: A popular package manager for Windows that focuses on automation, ensuring consistent installations and updates.
- **Scoop**: A command-line installer for Windows that emphasizes simplicity, minimalism, and the use of portable applications.
- **WinGet**: The official package manager for Windows, developed and maintained by Microsoft, designed to provide a curated set of applications from the Microsoft Store and other sources.
- **NuGet**: A package manager specifically tailored for .NET developers, allowing them to easily manage libraries and dependencies within their projects.

Each package manager has its strengths, quirks, and supported repositories. The documentation within this repository aims to highlight these differences and provide guidance on selecting the most suitable package manager for different use cases.
